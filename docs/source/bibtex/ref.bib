ABSTRACT = {Compared to single source systems, stereo X-ray CT systems allow acquiring projection data within a reduced amount of time, for an extended field-of-view, or for dual X-ray energies. To exploit the benefit of a dual X-ray system, its acquisition geometry needs to be calibrated. Unfortunately, in modular stereo X-ray CT setups, geometry misalignment occurs each time the setup is changed, which calls for an efficient calibration procedure. Although many studies have been dealing with geometry calibration of an X-ray CT system, little research targets the calibration of a dual cone-beam X-ray CT system. In this work, we present a phantom-based calibration procedure to accurately estimate the geometry of a stereo cone-beam X-ray CT system. With simulated as well as real experiments, it is shown that the calibration procedure can be used to accurately estimate the geometry of a modular stereo X-ray CT system thereby reducing the misalignment artifacts in the reconstruction volumes.},
